## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added

- Optional per-account `apiBaseUrl`, passed to the SDK client as
  `clientOptions.baseUrl`, so an account can talk to a relay, proxy or mirror
  instead of the default `https://platform-api2.max.ru`. Unset behaves exactly
  as before.

  The value is validated once, when the account starts: a malformed URL or a
  scheme other than `http`/`https` fails the account with an explicit error
  rather than throwing on the first API call, where it would surface only as an
  endless poll-loop restart. A base URL carrying a path gets a trailing slash
  added, because the SDK resolves methods relatively — without it
  `https://relay.example.com/api` would silently resolve to
  `https://relay.example.com/messages`. Plain `http` is allowed for a loopback
  relay but logs a warning: the bot token travels in the `Authorization` header
  of every request.

  Two limits are worth knowing. Media is not routed through this base — upload
  targets and inbound attachment URLs come from the API response — so a gateway
  with no route to the `*.oneme.ru` hosts still fails on files while text works.
  And the host sees the token and every message, so it should be one you
  control.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-08

Upgrade to `@maxhub/max-bot-api` 0.3.1 (was 0.2.2).

**Operational prerequisite:** since SDK 0.2.4 the client talks to
`platform-api2.max.ru`, whose certificate chains to the Russian Trusted Root CA
(Минцифры). Without that root in the gateway process's trust store every
request fails with `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`. `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
must be set before Node starts; setting it through OpenClaw's `env.vars` at
runtime is too late and silently does nothing. The upload hosts
(`iu.oneme.ru`, `fu.oneme.ru`) use Let's Encrypt and need nothing.

### Removed

- `rawUpload` and `patches/@maxhub+max-bot-api+0.2.2.patch`. The upstream bug is
  fixed: 0.2.2's `uploadFromBuffer` accepted a `token` argument it never
  destructured, so the token from `getUploadUrl` was dropped; 0.3.1 forwards it
  and falls back to it when the upload response is not JSON. Verified against
  the live API from both a path and a Buffer source.

### Changed

- Uploads go through the SDK's own `uploadImage`/`uploadVideo`/`uploadAudio`/
  `uploadFile`, which brings chunked range uploads, so the previous "files over
  ~10MB may time out" limitation is gone.
- Buffer sources are staged through a temp file. The SDK names a Buffer upload
  with `randomUUID()`, which would reach the recipient instead of the real
  filename, and the path route is also the one with chunked upload.
- `bot.start()` takes the new `{ mode: "polling", options }` shape.
- `allowedUpdates` is typed from the public `Bot["start"]` signature instead of
  being cast to `never`. `UpdateType` and `AttachmentRequest` are not
  re-exported by the package, so both are derived from public signatures rather
  than reached for through internal paths.

### Notes

- Methods this plugin uses — `sendMessageToChat`, `sendMessageToUser`,
  `editMessage`, `raw.uploads.getUploadUrl` — are unchanged across the upgrade.
  `editMyInfo` and `getChatByLink` were removed upstream; neither was used.
- 0.3.1 also adds a Comments API, chat-admin management, webhook support with
  `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`, and `clientOptions.fetch`/`baseUrl`. None are used
  yet; webhooks would replace the polling restart machinery but need a public
  domain.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-08

Code-review pass. **Breaking:** an unset `dmPolicy` is now enforced as
`"pairing"` instead of being ignored, so an install that never set the field
will start asking existing users to pair.

### Security

- **An unset `dmPolicy` disabled access control entirely** while
  `security.resolveDmPolicy` reported `"pairing"` to core (the SDK helper
  defaults to it), so the channel looked gated and was not. Inbound now applies
  the same `"pairing"` default it advertises.
- **Outbound sends read any absolute path off disk.** Local media is now read
  through the host's `mediaReadFile`, or from inside `mediaLocalRoots`; a path
  outside them is refused. Previously an agent could put
  `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` in a media field and have the gateway upload its
  own config, tokens included.
- **Local paths scraped out of model-authored reply text** are confined the same
  way, against the agent's own media roots.
- **Remote media is fetched through the SDK's SSRF guard** instead of a bare
  `fetch`, so a URL can no longer reach loopback or private-network hosts.
- **Inbound attachments were downloaded and written to disk before the access
  check.** Downloads now happen only after the sender is authorized, capped at
  10 attachments and 25 MB each.
- **`recordLastUsedContext` ran before the access check**, letting a blocked
  sender become the chat that `max_send_file` writes to. It is now recorded only
  for senders that passed the gate.

### Fixed

- `max_send_file` sent through whichever bot registered first instead of the
  account that owns the recorded chat; it now resolves the api by that account's
  token.
- Outbound account resolution no longer falls back to the first running bot.
  That fallback silently re-introduced the cross-account misrouting 0.2.0 claimed
  to fix whenever a poll loop was down or a token had been rotated.
  `pairing.notifyApproval` picked its bot the same way and is now account-scoped.
- `gateway.stopAccount` tore down every account. Stopping one account no longer
  kills its siblings, and `reload.accountScopedRestart` is now declared.
- **A crash-restarted bot was created with no event handlers**, so after any poll
  loop failure the channel kept polling and silently dropped every inbound
  message. Bot construction and handler wiring now happen together.
- A pending restart timer is cancelled on stop and can no longer resurrect a
  replaced bot, which previously left two bots polling one account with only one
  of them stoppable.
- `resolveChatId` accepted `""` and `"max:"` because `Number("")` is `0`, and
  accepted non-integers; both now raise a clear error instead of sending to
  chat 0.
- The gateway logger stringified its arguments, destroying `Error` stacks in the
  log the README tells operators to read. Arguments are forwarded untouched.

### Changed

- `capabilities.edit` is now `false`. The `editMessage` branch was unreachable —
  no context core passes carries a message id — so the channel was advertising an
  edit path that did not exist. The dead branch is gone.
- `accounts.*.allowedUpdates` and `accounts.*.botId` are read now. Both were
  documented in the manifest but ignored: the update list was hardcoded and
  `botId` never consulted. `botId` serves as the self-message filter when the
  SDK does not supply `myId`.
- The message adapter is built from the same outbound object the channel
  exposes, so the two cannot drift apart.
- The `streaming` config schema now carries core's full shape and no longer
  closes the top-level node. 0.3.0 declared a narrowed set with
  `additionalProperties: false`, which turned core-supported keys
  (`mode: "partial"`, `nativeTransport`, `preview`, `progress`) into hard config
  validation failures.

### Removed

- `getAllBots` from the registry: nothing used it after the account-resolution
  fixes, and it was the mechanism behind every "first bot wins" bug above.
- Exported type `MaxMediaContext`, which described a context shape the plugin no
  longer receives.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- Block streaming support. `maxChannel.streaming.blockStreamingCoalesceDefaults`
  supplies coalescing defaults (`minChars: 280`, `idleMs: 900`), which the core
  uses as a fallback when the config sets none. Every block Max delivers is a
  separate Bot API send, so the defaults are deliberately chunky.
- `streaming` in the channel config schema, so `channels.max.streaming.*` can be
  authored without rebuilding the plugin. Declared keys: `mode` (`off`/`block`),
  `chunkMode`, and `block.{enabled,coalesce.{minChars,maxChars,idleMs}}`.
  `preview` and `progress` are deliberately left out: they configure live-preview
  editing, and this channel ships no `message.live` adapter to honour them.

Block streaming still has to be turned on. It activates only when
`agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` is `"on"` (or a per-channel equivalent);
these two changes just make Max participate correctly once it is.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-07

Migration to the OpenClaw 2026.9 plugin SDK. **Breaking:** this release requires
OpenClaw 2026.9.2 or newer and will not load on older versions.

### Fixed

- **Outbound messages were sent from the wrong bot in multi-account setups.**
  `outbound.sendText` and `outbound.sendMedia` read `ctx.account` and
  `ctx.chatId`, neither of which exists on `ChannelOutboundContext`. Account
  resolution therefore always fell through to "the first bot that registered".
  The account is now resolved from `cfg` + `accountId`.
- **Sends returned a result the gateway could not use.** `{ ok: true }` was
  returned where `OutboundDeliveryResult` requires `channel` and `messageId`,
  which broke reply correlation. Sends now return a receipt carrying the Max
  message id (`body.mid`) and timestamp.
- Gateway logging in `startAccount` no longer risks writing every line twice.

### Added

- `message` adapter (`createChannelMessageAdapterFromOutbound`), so the channel
  is reachable from the shared message tool that core now owns.
- `src/setup-entry.ts` (`defineSetupPluginEntry`), which OpenClaw loads instead
  of the full entry while the channel is disabled or unconfigured.
- `reload.configPrefixes`, `config.inspectAccount`, `config.isConfigured`,
  `config.unconfiguredReason` and `gateway.stopAccount`.
- Contract test proving the adapter's declared receive ack policy, plus a test
  covering delivery through the adapter.
- `assets/icon.png` — plugin icon, per the 2026.9.2 branding rule.

### Changed

- All SDK imports moved from the removed `openclaw/plugin-sdk` barrel to narrow
  subpaths (`channel-core`, `channel-outbound`, `channel-policy`,
  `channel-pairing`, `reply-payload`, `runtime-store`, `runtime-env`,
  `config-contracts`, `inbound-reply-dispatch`).
- Entry point moved to `defineChannelPluginEntry`, which performs channel
  registration itself and gates work by registration mode so root help no longer
  activates the full runtime.
- `maxChannel` is typed as `ChannelPlugin<MaxAccountConfig>`; both `as never`
  casts at registration are gone and the contract is now compiler-checked.
- `core.config.loadConfig()` → `core.config.current()`.
- Pairing uses `createChannelPairingController`; the previously used
  `issuePairingChallenge` and `createScopedPairingAccess` are no longer public.
- `createPluginRuntimeStore` now uses the `{ pluginId, errorMessage }` form, so
  duplicate SDK module instances share one runtime slot.
- `openclaw.plugin.json` rewritten for the current manifest format: `activation`,
  `contracts.tools`, and `channelConfigs.max` with an account schema and UI hints
  (token marked `sensitive`).
- `package.json` declares `openclaw.setupEntry`, `openclaw.compat`,
  `openclaw.build` and `engines.node`; the `openclaw` peer range is raised to
  `>=2026.9.2`.
- Exported types: `MaxOutboundContext` replaced by `MaxSendContext` and
  `MaxSendResult`, which match what the SDK actually passes and expects.

### Removed

- `engines.openclaw` from the manifest — the field no longer exists; version
  compatibility is declared through `openclaw.compat` in `package.json`.

### Known limitations

- `dispatchInboundReplyWithBase` is still used for inbound dispatch. The SDK
  marks it deprecated, but its removal is gated on the next plugin-SDK major,
  and replacing it means rewriting the inbound path.
- Secret and env references are not resolved for `token`; it must be a literal
  string.

## [0.1.0]

file messaging, inbound attachments, DM access control, per-sender agent
routing, and the `max_send_file` tool.

  for authorized messages, scoped to account/chat with reference-counted teardown.
- Stop timers and in-flight action requests on completion/error/account shutdown.
- Resolve local media aliases canonically so staged PDF/image delivery retains
  the host's media-root boundary.
- SDK build/typecheck pinned to OpenClaw 2026.9.7, with lifecycle and media tests.
# 0.8.0 — reliable inbound files (2026-10-02)

- Extract direct, captioned, forwarded and replied-to attachments, including
  LinkedMessage.message as MessageBody and null outer bodies.
- Preserve sender/chat authority and keep quoted/forwarded commands out of CommandBody.
- Populate structured OpenClaw media context, preserve filenames/MIME types,
  enforce bounded downloads, and make failures visible to the agent.
